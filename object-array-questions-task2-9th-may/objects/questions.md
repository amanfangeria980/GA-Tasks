1: Creating and Manipulating Objects

Create a JavaScript object to represent a person's information and perform various manipulations on the object.

Instructions:
    - Define a JavaScript object representing a person, with properties such as `name`, `age`, `email`, and `address`.
    - Write functions to modify the properties of the person object, such as changing the `age` or `email`.
    - Add a new property to the object representing the person's hobbies.
    - Write a function to display the person's information in a formatted string.

2:Nested Objects and Arrays

Create a JavaScript object to represent a student's academic record, including nested objects and arrays.
Instructions:
    - Define a JavaScript object representing a student, with properties such as `name`, `grade`, and `subjects`.
    - The `subjects` property should be an array of objects, each representing a subject with properties such as `name` and `score`.
    - Write functions to add a new subject to the student's record and to update the score for a specific subject.
    - Write a function to calculate and return the student's average score across all subjects.

3: Object Destructuring and Methods

Create a JavaScript object to represent a car and work with object destructuring and methods.
Instructions:
    - Define a JavaScript object representing a car, with properties such as `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color`.
    - Include a method in the car object to return a formatted string describing the car (e.g., "2023 Toyota Corolla").
    - Use object destructuring to extract specific properties (e.g., `make`, `model`) and display them.
    - Write a function to change the car's color and call the car's description method to verify the change.
